#desc: Associativity for operator categories.

# 7 operator categories
#    selector
#    unary
#    multiplicative
#    additive
#    comparison
#    conjunction
#    disjunction

ASSERT: function (condition: bool, msg: string): bool {
  if (not condition) {
    emit stdout <- msg;
  }
  return condition;
};

T: bool = true;
F: bool = false;


#inst: How to test associativity for unary operators
#inst: unary operators can come only on left of operand (so associativity
#inst: has to be right). eg op1 op2 operands

#inst: How to test associativity for selector operators.
#inst: selector operators can come only on right of operand (so associativity
#inst: has to be left). eg operand op1 op2
