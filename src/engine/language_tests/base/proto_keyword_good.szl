# Proper uses of the 'proto' keyword

#
# At the beginning of a statement 'proto' is treated as part of a proto clause.
#

{
  proto "proto2.proto"  # nested protos
}
f: function() {
  proto "proto_append.proto"
};

# Test that we detect the boundary between the end of the generated proto and
# the beginning of the include at the same include level even though the scanner
# proceeds directly to the first symbol of the included file.

proto "proto3.proto"
include "include_dir/b.szl"

# Test that we still detect and handle multiple inclusion
proto "proto1.proto"

#
# Inside of a statement 'proto' is treated as a proto tuple keyword.
#

a: proto { i: int } = B"";
b: proto { proto {}, int } = B"";
