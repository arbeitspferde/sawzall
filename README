Szl - An implementation of Google's Sawzall language for
statistical aggregation of log data.

C++ Installation - Unix
=======================

To build and install the Szl compiler, the Sawzall language plugin for
the protocol compiler and associated libraries execute the following:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make check
  $ make install

If "make check" fails, you can still install, but it is likely that
some features will not work correctly on your system.
Proceed at your own risk.

"make install" may require superuser privileges.

For advanced usage information on configure and make, see INSTALL.txt.

** Hint on install location **

  By default, the package will be installed to /usr/local.  However,
  on many platforms, /usr/local/lib is not part of LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
  You can add it, but it may be easier to just install to /usr
  instead.  To do this, invoke configure as follows:

    ./configure --prefix=/usr

  If you already built the package with a different prefix, make sure
  to run "make clean" before building again.
