# When a string is allocated during static initialization and contains UTF-8,
# an OffsetMap will be allocated.  The bug was that if the first index operation
# occurred after static initialization, the OffsetMap of the string would be in
# garbage-collected memory and the pointer to it would go stale at the first
# garbage collection, triggering a crash.

# This program is simple enough to trigger the bug in the pre-fixed code if
# we first do
#	export SZL_ARG="--pattern=グーグル"
# and then run szl over a simple file of text.

static szl_arg: string = getenv("SZL_ARG");
a := string(szl_arg[0]);
b := string(szl_arg[1]);
