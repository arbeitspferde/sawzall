# Constant folding of miscellaneous non-"Binary" operators.
# Relies on getting a warning for divide by zero, so we can tell
# that the folding must actually have occurred.
# Also tests generation of warnings for folding operations that fail.
# (This would be a reasonable place to put a test for RuntimeGuard,
# but since the only use of RuntimeGuard is for the array to tuple conversion
# and we do not currently have constant arrays nor array length propagation,
# RuntimeGuard will never be constant folded.)
