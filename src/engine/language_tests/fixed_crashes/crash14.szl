# This covers a fixed code generation bug in 64-bit mode. Callee-saved registers
# are saved by push instructions in each function prologue. Since the final list
# of registers is only known in the epilogue, these "push reg" instructions need
# to be patched by no-op instructions when generating the epilogue. Upper regs
# in 64-bit mode need 2-byte push instructions. These were not patched
# correctly, causing extra registers to be pushed, which was harmless, except
# for the additional resulting stack padding causing stack misalignment (and
# performance penalty). Fixed by cl 7496670.
