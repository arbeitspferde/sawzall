# This caused an assert fault in the ELF file generator. The rewrite of the when

# second break statement is correctly recognized as dead code by the native code
# generator and gets eliminated. However, because the code range of the dead
# break statement was not empty but still pointing to the first shared break
# statement, the corresponding line information survived and confused the ELF
# file generator.
